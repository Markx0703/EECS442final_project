Our project based on the paper: http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/ijcv2007.pdf

We tried to reimplement the code from https://github.com/CorentinBrtx/image-stitching/blob/main/main.py. We use this for reference. However, we basically write the code by ourselves. Our baseline is the homework PS8. 

We add features like fill_and_smooth. 

Our workflow is combining several images, filling in the black spaces, smoothing the boundaries, and upload the pictures to diffusion model to get a stylized panorama as our result.
