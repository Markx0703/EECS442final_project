# EECS442final_project
Advanced Image Stitching. By: Guangyi Xu, Chun-Yu Fang, Sriram Bettagere
Our project is based on the paper: http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/ijcv2007.pdf


Our workflow is combining several images, filling in the black spaces, smoothing the boundaries, and upload the pictures to diffusion model to get a stylized panorama as our result.
