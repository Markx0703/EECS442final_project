# EECS442final_project

Our project based on the paper: http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/ijcv2007.pdf

For some features we referenced https://github.com/CorentinBrtx/image-stitching/blob/main/main.py. However, most of the code is ours.

We add features like fill_and_smooth.

Our workflow is combining several images, filling in the black spaces, smoothing the boundaries, and upload the pictures to diffusion model to get a stylized panorama as our result.
